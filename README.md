# Hackwarts
## Synopsis
This is a web-based complaint registration system for GIKI built for Hackwarts. The system allows students to register their complaints, track their complaints, and receive updates on their complaints. The system also provides an interface for administrators to manage complaints and assign them to different departments for resolution.

## Technologies Used
This project uses the following technologies:
- Python
- Flask (Python web framework)
- HTML
- CSS
- SQLite (database)

## Features
The complaint registration system has the following features:
- User Registration: Users can register their complaints by entering their registration number and filling out a complaint form.
- Complaint Tracking: Users can track the status of their complaints by entering their registration number and complaint ID.
- Administrator Dashboard: Administrators can view all complaints and assign them to different departments for resolution.
- Department Dashboard: Departments can view complaints assigned to them and provide updates on their status.

## Progress So Far:
- At present, only the frontend concept and prototype has been made for this system on Figma which can be viewed here: https://www.figma.com/proto/4EBUl5ktDeRVXnGw6cZ15q/Untitled?node-id=1-2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2
- The main hurdles have been approached with regards to converting our Figma concept to html and css files and link it to our backend code.
- Our backend code is available in the app.py file.

## A Side Project
In order to complement our system, we came up with another Food Delivery System which was named GIKI Mart. GIKI Mart is a one-stop solution for all the needs of a student, streamlining the process and removing the hurdles. Instead of giving separate orders to everyone at Tuck, you can simply use GIKI Mart and we'll handle the hassle for you. The project was not worked upon beyond the prototyping phase because of certain technical challenges and hurdles related to its applications.
The prototype for GIKI Mart can be seen here: https://www.figma.com/proto/RFDyiDZyK4szEwiJi0WCum/Untitled?node-id=59-6&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2
